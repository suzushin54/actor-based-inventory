# Actor-Based Inventory System Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development path for enhancing this actor-based inventory system as a learning and experimentation sample.

## Phase 1: Core Actor Pattern Implementation

- [ ] Implement supervision strategies (One-for-One, One-for-All, Rest-for-One)
- [ ] Refine actor hierarchy to better represent domain concepts
- [ ] Expand message patterns (Request-Response, Pub-Sub, Fire-Forget)
- [ ] Add actor lifecycle management
- [ ] Implement proper state recovery mechanisms

## Phase 2: Distributed Actor System

- [ ] Set up remote actors using Proto.Actor's remote capabilities
- [ ] Implement clustering across multiple nodes
- [ ] Add CRDT-based state synchronization
- [ ] Implement actor discovery mechanism
- [ ] Add metrics collection for distributed system health

## Phase 3: Reactive System Concepts

- [ ] Complete Event Sourcing and CQRS pattern implementation
- [ ] Add backpressure handling mechanisms
- [ ] Implement circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- [ ] Add dynamic scaling based on load
- [ ] Implement bulkhead pattern for fault isolation

## Phase 4: Advanced Stream Processing

- [ ] Integrate with Apache Flink/Beam for advanced stream processing
- [ ] Implement streaming SQL capabilities for actor state queries
- [ ] Add Complex Event Processing (CEP) for pattern matching
- [ ] Implement windowing operations for time-based analytics
- [ ] Create stream processing topologies across actor systems

## Phase 5: Integration with Modern Technologies

- [ ] Add GraphQL interface alongside gRPC/REST
- [ ] Experiment with WebAssembly for client-side processing
- [ ] Integrate WebRTC for real-time communication
- [ ] Implement distributed tracing with OpenTelemetry
- [ ] Connect with Temporal for complex workflow management

## Phase 6: Experimental Actor Extensions

- [ ] Build time-aware actors for time-based behaviors
- [ ] Implement state machine actors for workflow management
- [ ] Create polyglot actors (communication between Go and Akka/JVM actors)
- [ ] Experiment with functional programming approaches for actors
- [ ] Implement location-transparent addressing

## Phase 7: AI and Analytics Integration

- [ ] Add online learning capabilities using actor-collected data
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection in actor-based systems
- [ ] Create predictive analytics for inventory and orders
- [ ] Build recommendation engines using actor data
- [ ] Implement federated learning across distributed actors

## Phase 8: Visualization and User Experience

- [ ] Create real-time dashboards for actor system state
- [ ] Build interactive visualizations for actor hierarchy and communication
- [ ] Implement 3D visualizations using Three.js/Babylon.js
- [ ] Add real-time event monitoring interface
- [ ] Create developer tools for debugging actor systems
